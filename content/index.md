Hi there! Thanks for stopping by 👋🏼

My name is Miguel Palau I'm a Web Developer from [Puebla, México](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla)

I love working with modern web technologies and I'm passionate about always staying sharp on my skills and learning new stuff all the time.

Also I enjoy working with and contributing to [open source](https://github.com/mike3run/) and also I love tweaking my terminal and [dotfiles](https://github.com/mike3run/dotfiles)

Currently I work as a FullStack Developer at [Pixel2Html](https://www.pixel2html.com/)

I organize a monthly Meetup in Puebla called [DevNights](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/DevNightsMX/) were we talk about open source technologies, eat some 🍕 and have a few 🍺. If you're around the area you should probably go 💁🏻.

Ocassionally I [tweet](https://twitter.com/mpalau) in a mix of spanish and english and write on [Pixel's Blog](https://www.pixel2html.com/blog/) and I'm also trying to blog more often here as well.

This webpage was built using [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/) and its hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feel free to check the [source code](https://github.com/mike3run/imike.pw)
